            The Federal Maritime Commission (FMC) is a US federal agency
            responsible for regulating US ocean borne international
            transportation. Licensed NVOCC's can negotiate contracts with steam
            ship lines and issue their own house bill of lading. Furthermore,
            they are bonded which provides a safety net and more support in case
            of emergencies due to the strict regulations set by the FMC.
